NodeRED Flows and Nodes<br/>
My honest attempts at learning NodeRED and in the process creating some applications which can be helpful.<br/>
Shoutout to [7h3rAm](https://github.com/7h3rAm) who inspired me to do this.

### [WeatherUpdates](https://github.com/shailesh99/NodeRed/tree/master/WeatherUpdates)
An application to give periodic weather (description and temperature for now) updates for my location Pearland, TX.<br/>
It uses OpenWeatherMap (node-red-node-openweathermap) and Say (node-red-contrib-say) nodes for fetching weather data and converting text to speech respectively.
